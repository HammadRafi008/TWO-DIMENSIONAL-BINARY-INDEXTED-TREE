# TWO-DIMENSIONAL-BINARY-INDEXTED-TREE
To answer range sum queries on a 2-D array efficiently, Binary Indexed Tree (or Fenwick Tree) is the best choice to solve sub matrix of any given matrix.

###	get_number(): 
The function  "get_number" takes attributes naming matrix and sumL  and will get the number of rows and number of columns through index.

###	Submatrix_submession():  
It takes attributes naming starting_col, starting_num_rows ,ending_num_columns and ending_num_rows and shows that the number of rows or columns could not be less than zero which is an basic condition. User cannot find out the result  of a null matrix. 

###	result:  
Result stores the sum of selected rows and cols.

###	Starting _ col: 
Starting columns of the required matrix.

###	Starting _num_ rows: 
Starting rows of the required matrix.

###	Ending _num_ columns:  
Ending columns of the required matrix.

###	Ending _num_ rows: 
Ending rows of the required matrix.
